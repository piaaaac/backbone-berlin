    Fortuna is a space for artistic and social practices. It has a deliberately open and flexible structure. The monthly contribution is paid according to individual needs and requirements of the members. The members are free in the design of their projects and the use of the space. A common tool is a shared calendar and a monthly meet up. The shared understanding of the group is an open, experimental, collaborative, care centered, and multi-sensory way of working and thinking. Public events can be hosted through each member’s specific approach and spreading trough different channels in their respective communities and networks.
    
    Fortuna was created as a result of a temporary interim use in November 2021. The choreographer and performer Hermann Heisig and the producer Leonie Kusterer had rented the former betting studio in order to bring together a number of artists and performers for a collaborative research. Some of the participants looked for ways to further develop the former shop as a project space.
